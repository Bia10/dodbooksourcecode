Data-oriented design book source code
-------

This source code was used to perform measurements on multiple devices to find numbers and validation for the data-oriented design book.

The source was normally compiled on Ubuntu Linux, but was also compiled on Raspberry Pi and termux using both GCC and Clang where possible to compare and contrast.

There are currently no working makefiles for MacOS, or Windows operating systems.
